Synthesis is *Too Damn Expensive!* That's why I've started TDE!, a **zero-profit, open-source synthesizer design, manufacture, and distribution project**. That means that when you buy a TDE! module, you pay precisely what it cost me to produce, and nothing more.

TDE! has one purpose, and one purpose only: **to make hardware synthesis as accessible as possible from both a usability and monetary standpoint.**

### Who's paying for this?

Me!

### But how will you make money?

I won't!

### What's the catch?

I'm not sure you can call this a "catch", but development will be significantly slower than other manufacturers. I am but one person, and need to pay my own bills before anything else. Think of TDE! less as a company, and more as a hobby that I'm sharing with the world.

### What's in store?

Currently, Eurorack modules are under development, many based on or using the Daisy platform. There's plenty of other ideas, but I'm tackling those one at a time. I don't yet have a timeline for first launch, but I'm aiming for mid-2025.
